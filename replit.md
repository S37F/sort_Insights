# Overview

This is a modern React-based sorting algorithm visualizer application built with TypeScript. The application provides an interactive environment for learning and understanding various sorting algorithms through real-time visualization. Users can select different sorting algorithms, adjust parameters like array size and animation speed, and observe step-by-step execution with performance metrics tracking. The app features algorithm information displays, performance benchmarking, and comparison tools to help users understand the theoretical and practical aspects of different sorting approaches.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React 18 with TypeScript, utilizing a modern component-based architecture. The application uses Vite as the build tool and development server for fast hot module replacement. The UI is constructed with shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, providing accessible and customizable interface elements. TailwindCSS handles styling with a comprehensive design system including dark mode support and CSS variables for theming.

State management is handled through React hooks, particularly custom hooks like `useSorting` for managing sorting algorithm state and visualization steps. The application uses TanStack React Query for any potential server-side state management and API calls. Framer Motion provides smooth animations for the visualization components and UI transitions.

The routing is implemented using Wouter, a lightweight client-side routing library. The application follows a single-page application (SPA) pattern with component-based navigation.

## Backend Architecture
The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript in ESM module format. The server architecture follows a modular approach with separate route handlers and a storage abstraction layer. Currently, the storage is implemented as an in-memory solution (`MemStorage`) but is designed with an interface (`IStorage`) that can be easily swapped for database implementations.

The server includes middleware for request logging, JSON parsing, and error handling. Development mode includes Vite integration for serving the frontend with hot module replacement capabilities.

## Data Storage Solutions
The application currently uses in-memory storage for any user or performance data through the `MemStorage` class. The system is configured for PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, as evidenced by the database configuration and Neon serverless setup, though the database schema and connection are not yet implemented.

The schema definitions in the shared layer include structures for algorithm performance tracking, algorithm metadata, and sorting step visualization data, preparing for future database integration.

## Authentication and Authorization
No authentication or authorization system is currently implemented. The storage interface includes basic user management methods (getUser, getUserByUsername, createUser), suggesting preparation for future user authentication features.

## Design Patterns
The application follows several key design patterns:
- **Component Composition**: UI components are built using composition patterns with shadcn/ui
- **Custom Hooks**: Business logic is abstracted into reusable hooks like `useSorting` and `useTheme`
- **Strategy Pattern**: Sorting algorithms are implemented as separate methods within the `SortingAlgorithms` class
- **Observer Pattern**: State changes trigger UI updates through React's reactive state system
- **Factory Pattern**: Algorithm selection and instantiation follows factory-like patterns

The visualization system uses a step-based approach where each sorting algorithm generates an array of `SortingStep` objects that contain the array state and metadata for each visualization frame.
